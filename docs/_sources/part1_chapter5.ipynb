    "# Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "## User Setup\n",
    "### Python\n",
    "Simply run the following line in command:\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip install chiquito\n",
    "```\n",
    "Then import chiquito in `.py` file. See more in the `\\examples` folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rust\n",
    "Add the following line to `[dependencies]` in `Cargo.toml`:\n",
    "```\n",
    "chiquito = { git = \"https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/chiquito.git\" }\n",
    "```\n",
    "Then use chiquito in `.rs` file. See more in the `\\examples` folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Contributor Setup\n",
    "### Python\n",
    "Clone this repo and navigate to the root directory of this repository:\n",
    "```\n",
    "git clone https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/chiquito/\n",
    "cd chiquito\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Chiquito's Python frontend uses PyO3 and Maturin to expose Rust APIs to Python. Maturin requires the user to locally build a Python virtual environment. Run the following script to create a Python virtual environment, install required packages, and build the project.\n",
    "```\n",
    "python3 -m venv .env # create virtual environment\n",
    "source .env/bin/activate # activate virtual environment\n",
    "pip install -r requirements.txt # install required python dependencies from requirements.txt\n",
    "pip install jupyterlab # install required package to run the Jupyter Lab\n",
    "maturin develop # build the project with rust bindings\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If the above doesn't work, follow the guide here: https://pyo3.rs/main/getting_started#python\n",
    "\n",
    "To test if your setup is successful, run the `fibonacci.py` example file using the following script in the virtual environment:\n",
    "```\n",
    "python3 example/fibonacci.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also run the `mimc7.py` example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "python3 example/mimc7.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If setup is correct, you should see an `OK(())` message printed in the terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rust\n",
    "Simply clone and modify this repo:\n",
    "```\n",
    "git clone https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/chiquito/\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Jupyter\n",
    "To modify and contribute to the Jupyter book `.ipynb` files in this book, you can use an IDE like VSCode. Alternatively, you can modify `.ipynb` files in the browser according to the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "First, install jupyter:\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip install jupyter\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, make sure you've set up your local Python virtual environment as directed above and install it as a Jupyter Lab Kernel called `chiquito_kernel`:\n",
    "```\n",
    "python -m ipykernel install --user --name=chiquito_kernel\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "After that, run the following:\n",
    "```\n",
    "cd book # navigate to the book subfolder\n",
    "jupyter lab # launch jupyter notebook in browser\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In browser, make sure you are using the Kernel we just created called `chiquito_kernel`, which you can change by going to the `Kernel` tab of Jupyter Lab's top menu bar and click `Change Kernel...`\n",
    "\n",
    "Chiquito's Python frontend requires using a Python virtual environment for its dependencies, which you should have setup following the [Python README](https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/chiquito/tree/main/src/frontend/python/README.md).\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, after cloning Chiquito, you need to run the following commands in your local machine (NOT in Jupyter):\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python3 -m venv .env # create virtual environment\n",
    "source .env/bin/activate # activate virtual environment\n",
    "pip install -r requirements.txt # install required python dependencies from requirements.txt\n",
    "maturin develop # build the project with rust bindings\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then install your local Python virtual environment as a Jupyter Lab Kernel called `chiquito_kernel`. \n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python -m ipykernel install --user --name=chiquito_kernel\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "After that, run the following: \n",
    "```bash\n",
    "cd tutorials # navigate to the tutorials subfolder\n",
    "jupyter lab # launch jupyter notebook in browser\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In browser, make sure you are using the Kernel we just created called `chiquito_kernel`, which you can change by going to the `Kernel` tab of Jupyter Lab's top menu bar and click `Change Kernel...`\n"
